#README for assigment1 course HPY414

Code in C programming language for 3 different ciphers(One time Pad, Ceasar's cipher and Vigenere's cipher).

Folder contains:
    -demo.c
    "Contains the main() function ,is responsible for all the prints and user inputs."

    -simple_crypto.c
    "Contains the 3 different cipher function implementations."

    -simple_crypto.h
    "Contains defines i.e.(Ceasar's key) and the cipher functions declaration."

    -makefile
    "make <- to create object files and make an executable called project1"
    "make clean <- to delete object files and executable created by make"

P.S.- In order for the ciphers to work correctly the user's input must be alphanumeric,
except the Vigenere's cipher which only accepts upper case letters as user input and key.

There are comments on the code for further code explanation.
